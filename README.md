# Film Industry Correlation Analysis

## 📌 Description
This project analyzes correlations between major film industry factors using Python and Pandas.

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains movie attributes such as budget, gross revenue, votes, director, writer, production company, year, country
- Used for exploring trends in audience engagement ,revenue and the gross earnings

## 🔍 Key Findings
- From Regrex Plot, the linear regression line represents the strong correlation of data
- Gross vs. Votes and Budget:  Moderate positive correlation or high correlation(0.63 and 0.75) suggests higher-grossing movies attract more audience engagement.
- Genre vs Budget and Gross : Weak negative correlation (-0.33 and -0.22) indicates some genres have lower budgets.
- Votes vs.Director and Writer: Near-zero correlation (0.000260 and 0.000892) suggests director names and writer names alone don’t impact engagement of audience.
